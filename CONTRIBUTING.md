## How to Contribute a Plugin

1. **Fork** the [RevoltPlugins repository, Discovery branch](https://github.com/AwesomeRevolt/RevoltPlugins/tree/discovery).
2. Add your plugin folder inside the main directory with all necessary files.
3. Update the metadata file (`plugins.json`) that contains:
   - `name`
   - `author`
   - `description`
   - `repo` (Repository link)
   - `tags` (array of descriptive tags)
   - `featured` (Please do not use this, this is mainly for AR team plugins :3)
   - `image` (URL to an icon or screenshot, optional - otherwise set to "null")
4. Make sure your metadata follows the [Plugin Metadata Format](#plugin-metadata-format).
5. Submit a Pull Request describing your plugin and any relevant details.
